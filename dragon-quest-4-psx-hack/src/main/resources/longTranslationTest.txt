Dragon Quest IV had a unique way of advancing the story. It was split into five
chapters. The first four chapters were told from the perspective of the hero's
future companions. The fifth chapter was the hero's quest. During that quest,
you would meet with and join with the companions whose stories were told in
earlier chapters. Then, with a full cast of companions the group would begin
their journey to save the world. Remakes add a sixth chapter, available after
completing the storyline.
